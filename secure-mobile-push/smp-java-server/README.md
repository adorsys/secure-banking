The notification backend can easily be setup by using an existing GCM endpoint and either migrating it (exchange urls) as described here:

https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/android/android-migrate-fcm#update_server_endpoints

or just leaving it as it is as GCM is still supported --> see link.
